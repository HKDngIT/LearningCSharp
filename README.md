This Repository currently contains files for the following projects in C# using Windows Forms:

# Simple programs
## A calculator
![Calculator](./Images/Calc_SS.jpg)  
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Some special operations like "inverse"

## A memory game
![Memory](./Images/Memory_SS.jpg)  
- Timer feature which starts when the start button is pressed and stops when all pairs have been found
- Counts the tries until all pairs have been found

# Programs with a touch of electrical science
## Program for Star-Delta-Transformation calculation
![StarDeltaCalculator](/Images/StarDeltaCalculator.jpg)  
- with error handling for invalid inputs
- invalid inputs are:
  - empty textboxes
  - the use of non digits
  - zero or negative values for the resistors
- in case of an error, a message box will show up with further detailed information

# Programs for math problems
## Matrice operations
![Matrices](/Images/Matrices.jpg)
- error handling for invalid inputs(same as in the Star-Delta-Calculator)
- basic matrice operations
- can calculate determinante of a 3x3 matrix
- can calculate inverse of a 3x3 matrix
- in case of no determinante/ 0-determinante an error window will pop up because no inverse exists
